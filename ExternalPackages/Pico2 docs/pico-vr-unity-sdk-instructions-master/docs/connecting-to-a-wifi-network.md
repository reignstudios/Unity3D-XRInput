Select the **WLAN** menu option, then the name of your Wi-Fi network.

Enter your Wi-Fi network's password in the input box that appears using the on-screen keyboard (you may have to click on the input box in order for it to appear). Select **Connect** when you are done.

Your Wi-Fi network should now have a green tick next to it.
