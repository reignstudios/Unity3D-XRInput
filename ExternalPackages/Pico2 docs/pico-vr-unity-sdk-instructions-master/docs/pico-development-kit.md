# Requesting a development kit

If you meet any of the following criteria you are eligible to [request a Pico Goblin development kit](https://users.wearvr.com/developers/devices/pico-goblin/development-kit-request) from WEARVR:

* You have one or more VR experiences listed on WEARVR that you wish to port to Pico Goblin.
* You wish to create a new VR experience for Pico Goblin and have a strong portfolio of other apps on WEARVR.


If you are not eligible to request a development kit, you can still create a Pico Goblin experience and let WEARVR test your app for you by [submitting a test build](https://users.wearvr.com/developers/devices/pico-goblin/test-builds). You can get in touch at `devs@wearvr.com` to discuss you circumstances.
